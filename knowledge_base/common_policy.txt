
OrbitAI Internal Communication Policy
Our Goal: At OrbitAI, we believe in open, efficient, and respectful communication. This document isn't about strict rules; it's a guide to help us collaborate effectively as we grow. Our goal is to keep everyone informed without creating unnecessary noise.

## Slack: The Digital Office
Slack is our primary tool for real-time conversations, quick questions, and team collaboration.

Use Public Channels First: Default to public channels for work-related discussions. This keeps information transparent and allows others to learn or contribute.

Threads are Your Friend: For any conversation that involves more than two replies, please start a thread. This keeps our main channels clean and easy to scan.

Respect Focus Time: Use @here and @channel sparingly, as they notify everyone in the channel. Only use them for truly urgent and important announcements.

Set Your Status: Use statuses (e.g., üóìÔ∏è In a meeting, üå¥ On vacation) to let others know your availability.

## Email: For Official Business
Email is for more formal, external communication or important internal announcements that need a permanent record.

Be Clear and Concise: Use a descriptive subject line (e.g., "Project Nova: Weekly Update"). Keep the body of the email focused and to the point.

Know Who to CC: Be mindful of who you include in an email chain. If someone's input is no longer needed, consider moving them to BCC or removing them from the thread.

Response Time: Aim to acknowledge important emails within 24 hours, even if it's just to say, "Got it, I'll look into this and get back to you by Friday."

## Meetings: For Collaboration
Meetings are for collaborative work, decision-making, and discussions that are too complex for Slack or email.

Have a Clear Agenda: Every meeting invitation must include a clear agenda with the topics to be discussed and the desired outcome.

Be on Time: Respect everyone's time by joining meetings promptly.

Come Prepared: Review the agenda and any pre-reading materials before the meeting starts.

30-Minute Default: Try to schedule meetings for 30 minutes by default. If more time is needed, be sure the agenda justifies it.

In short: Be thoughtful, be respectful, and choose the right tool for the job. Let's build something amazing together!

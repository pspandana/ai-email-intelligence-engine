
Project Brief: Project Nova
Company: OrbitAI
Date: August 20, 2025
Project Sponsor: Head of Product

## 1. Project Summary
Project Nova is a strategic initiative to design, develop, and integrate a new customer sentiment analysis feature into our flagship 'Starlight Platform'. This feature will automatically analyze customer feedback from various sources (e.g., support tickets, reviews, surveys) to classify sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral. The insights will be displayed in a new, interactive dashboard, empowering our clients to better understand customer satisfaction, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions to improve their products and services.

## 2. Objectives
Develop a high-accuracy sentiment analysis model: Deliver a machine learning model capable of classifying text-based customer feedback with an accuracy of over 85% on our internal benchmarks.

Seamlessly integrate with the Starlight Platform: Natively embed the sentiment analysis results into the existing platform, ensuring a consistent and intuitive user experience. This includes creating a new, dedicated analytics dashboard.

Provide actionable insights: The new feature must empower users to not only view sentiment scores but also to drill down into key topics and trends, helping them identify specific drivers of customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction.

Launch by Q1 2026: Complete development, testing, and deployment to all Starlight Platform users by the end of Q1 2026.

## 4. Timeline
The project is broken down into five key phases with the following estimated schedule:

Phase 1: Research & Planning (Aug 25, 2025 - Sep 5, 2025)

Finalize technical requirements.

Gather and preprocess initial training data.

Select the core machine learning model architecture.

Phase 2: Model Development & Training (Sep 8, 2025 - Oct 17, 2025)

Train and validate the first version of the sentiment model.

Iterate on the model to improve accuracy.

Phase 3: Backend Integration (Oct 20, 2025 - Nov 14, 2025)

Develop the API to serve model predictions.

Integrate the API with the Starlight Platform's data ingestion pipeline.

Phase 4: Frontend & Dashboard Development (Nov 17, 2025 - Jan 9, 2026)

Build the interactive dashboard based on UX designs.

Connect the frontend to the backend API.

Phase 5: Testing & Deployment (Jan 12, 2026 - Feb 13, 2026)

Conduct end-to-end quality assurance (QA) testing.

Perform a beta launch with select customers.

Full production launch.

## 5. Risks
Risk	Likelihood	Impact	Mitigation Strategy
Model accuracy is below target	Medium	High	Allocate additional time for data cleaning and feature engineering. Explore alternative pre-trained models if initial results are poor.
Lack of sufficient training data	Medium	High	Work with the product team to source additional customer feedback data. Use data augmentation techniques to expand the dataset.
Poor user adoption	Low	Medium	Involve the UX Designer in early-stage development and conduct usability testing with a sample of clients before the beta launch.
Delay in a key phase	Medium	Medium	The Project Manager will hold weekly check-ins to monitor progress against the timeline and identify potential blockers early.
